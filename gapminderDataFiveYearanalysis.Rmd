`r IIIdata<- subset(data, country=="Mali" | country=="Oman" | country=="Italy")`

Mali has lower GDP consistently than OMan

`r ggplot(data=IIIdata, aes(x=year, y=gdpPercap), color = country) + geom_point(aes(shape=country))`

Calculate the mean, min, and max life expectancies for each continent (hint: you use aggregate() if you like). Describe what you see in the results using a markdown text.
maxagg<- aggregate(lifeExp ~ country, IIIdata, FUN=max)
> aggdata<- aggregate(lifeExp ~ country, IIIdata, FUN=min)
> View(aggdata)
> minagg<- aggdata
maxagg<- aggregate(lifeExp ~ country, IIIdata, FUN=mean)

Commit your changes using git and push them to github.

Make a 2 histograms of global life expectancy using ggplot. One with the default bin widths and one with narrower bin widths (you can check in the pdf from yesterday's lesson for the syntax you might need to do this). Explain the differences and any interesting trends in markdown text.

Compile the final Rmd file to html, make sure it looks ok, and then commit this html file as well (should be in your working directory) and push everything to github.
